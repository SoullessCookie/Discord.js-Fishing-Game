# Discord.js-FIshing-Game

This code defines a simple fishing game in which the player can use the !fish command to catch a random fish. The fish that the player catches are determined by their rarity level, with rarer fish being harder to catch. You can modify this code to suit the specific gameplay and mechanics of your fishing game.
